# Contributing to Relativity Testing Framework Api

Welcome to the Relativity.Testing.Framework.Api repository.

Please review the [Relativity.Testing.Framework contributing guide]((https://git.kcura.com/projects/TT/repos/relativity.testing.framework/browse/CONTRIBUTING.md)), if you have not already.

Be aware that this repository relies heavily on [Models](https://git.kcura.com/projects/TT/repos/relativity.testing.framework/browse/source/Relativity.Testing.Framework/Models) and [Mapping](https://git.kcura.com/projects/TT/repos/relativity.testing.framework/browse/source/Relativity.Testing.Framework/Mapping) from the Relativity.Testing.Framework library.
If you are adding or making changes to any of the services or strategies that use them, it's possible that you will need to make a change to Relativity.Testing.Framework first.
For this reason, all builds of Relativity.Testing.Framework publish a package to Artifactory.
